//! @var Options::SINGLEPRECISION
//! Uses single precision floating point values (IEEE 754 Standard rev. 2008) for internal
//! computation. This should be the preferred setting for most application as double precision performance will be,
//! sometimes significantly, reduced, depending on the actual GPU in use.
//!

//! @var Options::DOUBLEPRECISION
//! Uses double precision floating point values for internal computation. This should only be used
//! if there are problems with the single precision computation (e.g. doesn't converge) as GPUs usually exhibit a
//! greatly reduced double precision performance. At the time of this writing, the target architecture is Nvidia's GK104
//! which should perform about over 2 TFLOPS for single point and about 100 GFLOPS for double precision.

//! This is the 'standard' parallelization type. The gpu will spawn a configurable number of threads and

//! @var Options::GENETIC
//! This algorithm is inspired by the genetic algorithms class of optimizations. After a configurable number
//! of rounds (see syncAfterRounds) all GPU threads pause and communicate their intermediate results. All threads
//! continue their operation using the best value that was found so far. TODO: explain similarity to GA
//!

//! @var Options::GENETIC_DISTRIBUTED
//! Same as 'Genetic' with the addition that the communication will not only happen between
//! the threads on a GPU but between all threads among all GPUs that are part of the run.
